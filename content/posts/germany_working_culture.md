![Alt text](https://media.tenor.com/UkSZmNYoAZ8AAAAM/german-germany.gif "Title")

## Cultural Values

Maintaining order: This value refers to punctuality because in Germany it is important that you appear on time to a meeting.
Personal space and the private sphere: The separation of the private and professional spheres is addressed here; private space and private time are important personal rights. The status of a person is determined by qualifications and career levelPrecision and accuracy: In order to understand an issue, there must be a thorough and targeted investigation of the relevant details. The successful implementation of an issue or matter requires systematic and analytical planning of the respective steps. The aim is not to find “a” solution, but the “best”solution. For this reason, a high standard of quality is expected Objectivity and rationality: In Germany, the separation of private and professional life is considered very important and there is often little significance placed on the development of personal relationships before entering a professional one. Expectations are gladly expressed directly and openlyReliability: “To stand by your word” is a matter of honor. Reliability thus represents an important value and virtue. Uncertainty and ambiguity are to beavoided where possibleDirectness: A direct expression of what you are thinking is appreciated in Germany. Transparency and predictability are seen as fundamental elements of both professional and social communication.

##  Types of communication

In Germany, a direct and open communication is often preferred. Important matters are explicitly expressed and the point is usually made quickly. A rejection or dismissal can be expressed with a clear “No”, whereas “Yes” is a sign of agreement and acceptance. Germans tend to separate the interpersonal from the factual.

##  Understanding of time

The majority of the Germans have a monochronic attitude to time, preferring to fo-cus on one thing at a time. Time plays a relatively important role. Planning and punctuality are regarded highly, and long-term thinking is common.

##  Introduction  & working language

In Germany, separation of the formal “Sie” (You) and the informal “Du” (You) is very important, as is the formulation of clear guidelines concerning formal address (“Sie”), i.e. depending on age, type of work, professional or private context, etc. In the office, it is customary to use “Herr” (Mr.) or “Frau” (Ms.), followed by the surname. Titles are only used if requested. At Bosch, titles are seldom used. Men and women shake hands when introduced; a brief, firm handshake is the standard greeting. Business cards are exchanged at the beginning or end of a meeting. German is the preferred language spoken, although the majority of German associates also have another language. Furthermore, written language in Germany is also very important.

##  Body language and personal space

Most Germans could be more expressive when it comes to showing their own emotional state through body language. Eye contact during a discussion is very important as this represents attentiveness, trust and honesty. Physical contact is ra-re if the relationship is still relatively new. The comfort zone generally extends out an arm’s length. Private space and personal time are deemed very important in Germany.

##  Presentations

Many associates think that a good presentation should include facts and sound arguments. The person giving the presentation gains credibility by demonstrating professional knowledge. In Germany, it is common to ask questions during a presentation, to provide critical feedback or even suggestions for improvement.

##  Meetings

Meetings in Germany are quite functional and take a structural approach to the problem. Decisions may be made at the start of a meeting; however it is more common for participants to be initially more cautious and to avoid time pressure. The aim and progress of the meeting is outlined at the start with the “agenda”. In most cases, a subordinate person chairs the meeting and every participant is expected to be well-prepared. During work meetings, arguments are won on the basis of facts; this is even the case when more emotional decisions need to be made. The minutes can be taken individually or by a person from the group.

##  Decision-making process

In Germany, there is a systematic approach taken when making decisions, i.e. any decisions made have normally been well-thought out. Any problem is carefully examined in order to gain a comprehensive understanding of what is involved. Finally, a conceptual basis is established, which includes fundamental methods and systematic approaches to solving the problem. Ideally, decisions are made in consensus, once all possible arguments have been heard. Independent of group decisions, associates have the right to make their own decisions.

##  Agreements

In Germany, contracts are regarded as the result of a negotiation process and not a declaration of any intended collaboration. A contract is binding for both parties. Information is often distributed slowly. An important concept on which the German perception of information transfer is based is the obligation to inform others and be informed.

##  Conflict management & criticism

In Germany, conflicts should be addressed and openly discussed. The majority of the Germans regard an open discussion as a way to clear the air. Conflicts are usually played out between the parties involved and without the help of a mediator. Constructive criticism, i.e. criticism coupled with a suggestion for improvement, is used as an important tool for driving progress. There is a tendency to criticize directly, without making positive comments beforehand; the criticism mainly refers more to the matter than the person who may be responsible for the problem.

## Negotiations

People are expected to be well prepared for negotiations in Germany. The ap-proach taken is systematic and argumentative, i.e. the arguments are based on sound facts and figures that are backed up by studies and analyses. Details are important and should be explained as accurately as possible. People have more of a long-term outlook, and regard themselves as being direct and honest negotia-tion partners. Contracts serve to regulate the conditions of any future cooperation.

## Hierarchy

The hierarchy of a German company is mainly based on function. Associates complete their tasks independently and prefer to have less interference from managers. Managers also expect their associates to work on their own. Furthermore, they expect to be informed of the status/progress made by the team and about any new developments. A good manager displays technical and/or organizational skills, as well as work experience. A participatory and cooperative management approach is common, as well as involving the team in the decision-making process. Contradicting or answering back to supervisors is commonly done. Praise is not always given, as a good performance does not need to be emphasized. Receiving sufficient space for the independent organization of work and being recognized as an expert are both motivational factors.

## Teamwork

Most teams are used to receiving general strategies from management and then coming up with possible solutions themselves. Once the team has accepted the goal, the individual team members take on the various tasks in accordance with their abilities. From a German point of view, a good team manager is the boss, however also regarded as simply another member of the team.
